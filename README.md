# imperomano_python_text_RPG
A text based RPG Project, setup in Python, named "Imperomano", which is derived from "Impero Romano", because the roman empire is a cool theme!

## What if ...

What if we take the Roman Empire and give a Fantasy Twist?
Fireball slinging Spartans definitely sounds cool to my ears!
